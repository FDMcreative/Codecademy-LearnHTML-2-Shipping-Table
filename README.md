# Codecademy-Table

I made use of
<table>
table rows <tr>
table headings <th>
<td colspan="2"> to use more than one column per entry (es. an event in calendar which spans multiple days)
<td rowspan"2"> to use more than one row per entry (es. an event in calendar which spans multiple hours)
<tbody> <thead> and <tfoot>
